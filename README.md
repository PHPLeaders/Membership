Membership
==========

I'm extremely sorry about the unforeseen problems caused by me (Corey) adding everyone and their brother to the PHPLeaders group. My intent for doing good was there by all means. I've removed every organizational member from all repositories for damage control purposes so you will no longer be receiving notifications.

The notifications issue was unanticipated and not something I envisioned Github would have enabled by default when adding organizational members. I had falsely assumed that Github would not do this as the default setting is to hide organizations form a user's profile and all public facing views. It also brings up the question as to why the default action for adding team members to an organization didn't require consent on their part.

For the disgruntled, please email me directly at corey@coreyballou.com to discuss. I'd be more than happy to remove anybody not wishing to participate from the group. You may also opt to remove yourself on your own accord. By default, your membership in this organization is hidden from public view.

## Purpose ##

This group formed after interest being expressed on the php.net UG-ADMINS mailing list. If you're unfamiliar with the list, it's for all PHP user group organizers which you can find at https://wiki.php.net/usergroups.

I spun the PHPLeaders group as one which active PHP community leaders form the organization. The membership is not restricted to UG organizers, but is open to figures in the community that have been noticed as going out of their way to promote PHP. The purpose of the PHPLeaders group itself is to strengthen the ties among thought leaders and bring awareness to web-facing PHP community projects and initiatives. The goal is to increase participation/contributions to projects and issues deemed notable by leaders which would most greatly have a positive impact on the PHP community. Andreas' http://php.ug website is on the list as a notable project that needs help and for users to step in, for instance, so that's why you see it forked within the PHPLeaders organization (to bring it visibility).
