## Purpose ##

This group formed after interest of being expressed on the php.net UG-ADMINS mailing list. If you're unfamiliar with the list, it's for all PHP user group organizers which you can find at https://wiki.php.net/usergroups.

The PHPLeaders group was created to band together PHP community leaders in the hopes of working on shared projects. 

#### Membership ####

The membership is not restricted to UG organizers, but is open to figures in the community that have been noticed as going out of their way to promote PHP. 

#### Purpose ####

The purpose of the PHPLeaders group itself is to strengthen the ties among thought leaders and bring awareness to web-facing PHP community projects and initiatives. 

#### Goal ####

The goal of this group is to increase participation/contributions to projects and issues deemed notable by leaders which would most greatly have a positive impact on the PHP community. For example, Andreas' [php.ug](http://php.ug) website is on the list as a notable project that needs help and for users to step in. This is why you see the project forked within the PHPLeaders organization, indicating it has been earmarked for visibility.
